Histoire et Licence
*******************


Histoire du logiciel
====================

Python a été créé au début des années 1990 par Guido van Rossum, au
Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, voir https://www.cwi.nl/) au
Pays-Bas en tant que successeur d’un langage appelé ABC. Guido est
l’auteur principal de Python, bien qu’il inclut de nombreuses
contributions de la part d’autres personnes.

En 1995, Guido continua son travail sur Python au Corporation for
National Research Initiatives (CNRI, voir
https://www.cnri.reston.va.us/) de Reston, en Viriginie, d’où il
diffusa plusieurs versions du logiciel.

En mai 2000, Guido et l’équipe de développement centrale de Python
sont parti vers BeOpen.com pour former l’équipe BeOpen PythonLabs. En
octobre de la même année, l’équipe de PythonLabs est partie vers
Digital Creations (désormais Zope Corporation; voir
http://www.zope.com/). En 2001, la Python Software Foundation (PSF,
voir http://www.python.org/psf/) voit le jour. Il s’agit d’une
organisation à but non lucratif détenant les droits de propriété
intellectuelle de Python. Zope Corporation en est un sponsor.

Toutes les versions de Python sont Open Source (voir
https://www.opensource.org/ pour la définition d’Open Source).
Historiquement, la plupart, mais pas toutes, des versions de Python
ont également été compatible avec la GPL, le tableau ci-dessous résume
les différentes versions.

Note: Compatible GPL ne signifie pas que nous distribuons Python
  sous licence GPL. Toutes les licences Python, excepté la licence
  GPL, vous permettent la distribution d’une version modifiée sans
  rendre open source ces changements. La licence « compatible GPL »
  rend possible la diffusion de Python avec un autre logiciel qui est
  lui, diffusé sous la licence GPL; les licences « non compatible GPL
  » ne le peuvent pas.

Merci aux nombreux bénévoles qui ont travaillé sous la direction de
Guido pour rendre ces versions possibles.

   Independent implementation of MD5 (RFC 1321).

   This code implements the MD5 Algorithm defined in RFC 1321, whose
   text is available at
         http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1321.txt
   The code is derived from the text of the RFC, including the test suite
   (section A.5) but excluding the rest of Appendix A.  It does not include
   any code or documentation that is identified in the RFC as being
   copyrighted.

   The original and principal author of md5.h is L. Peter Deutsch
   <ghost@aladdin.com>.  Other authors are noted in the change history
   that follows (in reverse chronological order):

   2002-04-13 lpd Removed support for non-ANSI compilers; removed
         references to Ghostscript; clarified derivation from RFC 1321;
         now handles byte order either statically or dynamically.
   1999-11-04 lpd Edited comments slightly for automatic TOC extraction.
   1999-10-18 lpd Fixed typo in header comment (ansi2knr rather than md5);
         added conditionalization for C++ compilation from Martin
         Purschke <purschke@bnl.gov>.
   1999-05-03 lpd Original version.

   Modified by Jack Jansen, CWI, July 1995:
   - Use binascii module to do the actual line-by-line conversion
     between ascii and binary. This results in a 1000-fold speedup. The C
     version is still 5 times faster, though.
   - Arguments more compliant with Python standard

OpenSSL

Les modules "hashlib", "posix", "ssl", et "crypt" utilisent la
bibliothèque OpenSSL pour améliorer les performances, si elle est
disponible via le système d’exploitation. Aussi les outils
d’installation sur Windows et Mac OS X peuvent inclure une copie des
bibliothèques d’OpenSSL, donc on colle une copie de la licence
d’OpenSSL ici:
